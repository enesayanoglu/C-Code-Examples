# Question2
Write a program that gets an integer value min and rolls a 6-sided die until it gets four consecutive
rolls in a row that have values of min or less than min.As the program rolls the die it should print
each value rolled and then it should print a message at the end to indicate how many rolls were made.
In first example, notice that the program stops after rolling 3,2,1, and 2 consecutively because these
are all values of 3 or less than 3.EXAMPLE:
Enter a min value: 3
524613553212
Finshed after 12 rolls!
